FCO Trigger Examples
====================

This repository consists of example triggers that can be used with
Flexiant Cloud Orchestrator version 4.0. Please feel free to
use or adapt these.

They are licensed under the Apache License version 2.0, as
set out in the file 'LICENCE', and are (c) 2013 Flexiant Ltd.

Some of the triggers will require your system to have additional
Lua modules installed on your system. We recommend installing
the appropriate .deb to achieve this.
